# Mobile Application Development

The goal of the application is to allow groups to share expenses (i.e. during a trip or between roommates).
The class is organized in this way: each two week there is a new assignement on a new feature of the application to implement before the due date and at the end of the semester the group presents the final result to the professor and to classmates.

The application uses Firebase as DB.
